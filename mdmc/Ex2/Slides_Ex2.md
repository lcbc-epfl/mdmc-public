# Exercise General Information
- Interviews 
    - 10 minutes discussion to test your understanding of the exercise
    - Good occasion to discuss your doubts and questions
- Report feedback
    - After your interview, you will get a detailed feedback via Moodle
        - No grade
        - Overall comment and detailed correction of the exercises
  
**Exercises contribute to 1/2 of final grade! We count the best 5 out of the 6 reports for your exercise grade.**

# Notebooks Reminder

- Always access the notebooks via  the rocket button on the top right of the code files and choose JupyterHub to launch [noto.epfl.ch](https://noto.epfl.ch/) 
- **Make sure to access noto this way each time you begin the exercise to ensure you have the latest version!**

# Exercise 2 - Intro & Tips

Today we'll be building a tool to compute the probability distribution of the energy of a system using Boltzmann statistics. The focus of the exercise is to refresh your notions of statistical mechanics, which is the foundation for all simulation techniques we'll see during the course.

- The theoretical part is about statistical thermodynamics.  \
  Be sure to know what we mean by
  - Thermodynamic ensembles
  - Microstate 
  - Partition function and why its useful
  - Boltzmann distribution
 
# Exercise 2 - Intro & Tips
- The practical part is about computing the Boltzmann distribution of a fictitious harmonic oscillator.  \
  For simplicity
  - Boltzmann constant = 1
  - Beta = 1/T
  - Energies represented as integer values 

# Exercise 2 - Intro & Tips

- Modify the code below to translate into code concepts from statistical mechanics
