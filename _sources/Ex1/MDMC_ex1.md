Basic Concepts of Molecular Dynamics and Monte Carlo Simulations
================================================================

In this first set of exercises, you will encounter some basic concepts
that are important in molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations.
Later in the course, you will be introduced to the underlying formal
derivations and relations. This set of exercises considers some general
concepts of practical significance, including the link between quantum
mechanics and classical mechanics, and a statistical approach to solving
certain mathematical problems.
