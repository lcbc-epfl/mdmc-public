# Properties from Molecular Dynamics


In this last set of exercises, you will be introduced to practical
applications of molecular dynamics. After a brief treatment of advanced
simulation concepts and an introduction to protein biochemistry, you
will analyse the folding of the Trp-cage miniprotein.
