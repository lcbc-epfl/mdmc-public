# Statistical Thermodynamics and the Boltzmann Distribution

This set of exercises brings together the theory of statistical mechanics with a practical
example, the harmonic oscillator. After a brief (re)introduction to statistical mechanics,
you will write a code that computes the probability distribution of the energy of a system
using Boltzmann statistics.
