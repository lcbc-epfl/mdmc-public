# Monte Carlo Simulations and the Photon Gas


In this set of exercises, you will be briefly introduced to the concept
of importance sampling and detailed balance in Monte Carlo simulations.
You shall then apply the Metropolis Monte Carlo scheme to sample a
photon gas and a Lennard-Jones system to obtain their respective
energies from proper phase-space averages.
