\begin{mdframed}
\textbf{Exercise 1 - Bonus}\\
Derive (\ref{eqpb2}) from (\ref{eqpb1}) by passing via the exponential form of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation (\ref{conc}).    Give an appropriate expression for the equilibrium charge density  $\rho_\text{ext}(\mathbf{r})$ in the Poisson-Boltzmann approach.

\begin{mdframed}
\textbf{Exercise 2}\\
How may the solvent environment (especially in the case of a polar
solvent, such as dimethylformamide (DMF), and a polar
hydrogen-bonding solvent, such as water) influence the properties
(conformation, reactivity) of the solute? Which solvent do you
expect to be more difficult to mimic by an implicit model, DMF or
water?

\begin{mdframed}
\textbf{Exercise 3}\\
In the context of the previous questions, explain possible advantages and pitfalls of using an implicit solvent compared to an explicit treatment.

\begin{mdframed}
\textbf{Exercise 4}\\
A protein has the tendency to fold much quicker in implicit than in explicit solvent. Why is this? What are possible issues?

\begin{mdframed}
\textbf{Exercise 5 - Bonus}\\
Is the computation of the pressure in
(\ref{pressure}), via the virial, more expensive in an MD and an MC
algorithm? And why?
\end{mdframed}

\textbf{Exercise 6 - Bonus}\\
Derive the ideal gas part of the virial in (\ref{virial}) using (\ref{virial_alt}).

\begin{mdframed}
\textbf{Exercise 7}\\
Follow the instructions in this file and run the folding simulation.
Calculate the correct number of steps for the simulations to run 50 ps of heating and 20 ns of dynamics and report those numbers in your report. These sections are marked in the following with \texttt{\#CHANGE HERE}.

\begin{mdframed}
\textbf{Exercise 8}\\
Include an image of the starting structure in your report. Are there any residues which  would contribute to the instability of the starting structure in its current conformation, why?
\end{mdframed}

Your answer here

\begin{mdframed}
\textbf{Exercise 9}\\
What type of structure is the folded Trp-cage miniprotein? List the main components contributing to this structure, including the residues which are responsible for their formation.
\end{mdframed}

\begin{mdframed}
\textbf{Exercise 10}\\
Explain the RMSD and RMSF plots.  Does the trajectory reach the same conformation as the experimental structure?
Which metric is more useful for the problem at hand? \textbf{Bonus:}  Provide a use case for the other metric.

\begin{mdframed}
\textbf{Exercise 13}\\
Why is it useful to constrain bond lengths for larger MD simulations (typically with the SHAKE algorithm)? Which bonds would you typically constrain in such a scenario, and why?
\end{mdframed}

\begin{mdframed}
\textbf{Exercise 14 - Bonus}\\
Which properties do you need to take into account in order to select an appropriate timestep for your MD simulation? Are there any other reasons you might wish to reduce or increase this timestep?
\end{mdframed}

Your answer here

\begin{mdframed}
\textbf{Exercise 15 - Bonus}\\
Is it better to sample 2 x 10 ns from the same starting structure or 1 x 20 ns in order to explore conformational space efficiently?
